As an employee with access to sensitive data, I wanted to create a project that would randomly generate a password based on certain criteria that I set.
After  the user clicks the button to generate a random password, the user will be prompted with questions based on the criteria that I set:
Must be between 8 and 128 characters
Must have AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
1. NUMBERS
2. LOWERCASE LETTERS
3. UPPERCASE LETTERS
4. SPECIAL CHARACTERS
After all prompted questions are answered then a password which meets said criteria will generate on the clipboard.
